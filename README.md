# reading_files_using_pandas
In this project, we work on a different type of files. 
The data come from multiple clients and data is heterogeneous type and it is converted into homogeneous type in python data frames (csv, json, xml, psv). 
All these source systems are some third-party databases. 
We also got source schema extract to understand the fields definition. Each data source system contains 3 types of datasets named Customers, Products, and Transactions.
